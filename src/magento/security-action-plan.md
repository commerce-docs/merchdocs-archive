If you suspect that your site is compromised, follow this action plan without delay.

1. **Diagnose**

    Run a scan to establish the security status of your Magento store.

1. **Clean**

    Hire a [qualified consultant](https://solutionpartners.adobe.com/s/directory/) or online service to clean your site of all malicious code. Check the `/media` folder for leftover executable code. Remove all unknown Admin users and reset all Admin passwords.

1. **Protect**

    Keep your Magento installation up to date with the most current release. If you are using an older version, apply all security patches as they become available. Review and follow [Adobe Commerce Security Best Practices](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/trust-center/ungated/whitepapers/experience-cloud/adobe-commerce-best-practices-guide.pdf). Subscribe to the [Adobe Security Notification Service](https://www.adobe.com/subscription/adbeSecurityNotifications.html).

1. **Report**

    If you think that you have found a specific vulnerability in Magento, send a description of the problem with technical details to [security@magento.com](mailto:security@magento.com?subject=Possible Magento Vulnerability).

1. **Upgrade**

    For the additional peace of mind that comes from 24/7 support, plan your upgrade to [Adobe Commerce on Cloud infrastructure](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-commerce.html) now.
