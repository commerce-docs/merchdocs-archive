Amazon Sales Channel gives you the ability to set pricing rules, which allow you to set your Amazon listing price different than your Price Source. Additionally, you can stack multiple rules and even use the intelligent pricing to adjust your Amazon listing price based on competitors' Buy Box price or the lowest competitor price.

There are two types of pricing rules:

- [Standard Pricing Rule]({% link sales-channels/amazon/standard-price-rules.md %})
- [Intelligent Repricing Rule]({% link sales-channels/amazon/intelligent-repricing-rules.md %})

   Intelligent repricing rules do not function properly if the Amazon region is set to `Inactive` status, as it is during onboarding. Your pricing calculations depend on your shipping rates, and your region must be in `Active` status for your shipping rates to sync from Amazon. <br/><br/>To update your region status in your Amazon account, go to Settings > Account Info > Vacation Settings. Refer to [Amazon: Listing Status for Vacations](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=200135620&amp;language=en_MX&amp;ref=ag_200135620_cont_191).

This feature allows you to manipulate your Amazon prices in a way that is very similar to Magento's [Catalog Price Rules]({% link catalog/pricing.md %}). You can create complex rules that allow you to change prices for specific products, products inside of specific categories, or even with specific attributes.

Another pricing option is a price override, which is set at the individual listing level. A price override can be set, and an override ignores/takes priority over all other defaults, settings, and rules. An override can be set for price, handling time, condition, and seller notes (with a few exceptions). See [Overrides]({% link sales-channels/amazon/overrides.md %}).
