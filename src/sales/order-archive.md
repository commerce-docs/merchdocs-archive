Archiving orders on a regular basis improves performance and keeps your workspace free of unnecessary information, so you can focus on current business. Invoices, shipments, and credit memos can be archived automatically or manually, and archived items can be viewed at any time.

Your store can be configured to archive orders, invoices, shipments, and credit memos after a set number of days. You can move orders and their associated documents to the archive, or restore them to their previous state. Archived orders are not deleted and remain available from the Admin. Archived data can be exported to a CSV file and opened in a spreadsheet. When enabled, the _Go to Archive_ function appears at the top of the Orders workspace.

The _Archive_ section appears in the [Sales menu]({% link sales/sales-menu.md %}) only when archiving is [enabled]({% link configuration/sales/sales.md %}).
