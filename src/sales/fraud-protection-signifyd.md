title: Signifyd Guaranteed Fraud Protection - Deprecated
---

{:.bs-callout-warning}
**Deprecation Notice** <br/>
Due to the continued evolution of many APIs, this fraud protection integration is at risk of becoming outdated and no longer security compliant in the future. For this reason, it is now deprecated and we are recommending that you disable it in your Magento configuration and transition to the [Signifyd Fraud & Chargeback Protection extension](https://marketplace.magento.com/signifyd-module-connect.html){:target="_blank"} that is available on Magento Marketplace.

Signifyd Guaranteed Fraud Protection automates your order review process so you can accept more orders and maximize revenue without chargeback losses. Signifyd automatically reviews orders for fraud, and indicates which orders to ship, and which to reject. The results of the Signifyd Guarantee Decision appear as a column in the [Orders]({% link sales/orders.md %}) grid.

Signifyd Guaranteed Fraud Protection protects every approved order with a financial guarantee against fraudulent chargebacks, so you can grow your business without fear of fraud.

## Step 1: Sign up for a Signifyd account

1. Complete the Signifyd [Guaranteed Fraud Protection][1] form to contact their Sales team.

1. Follow their one-click installation instructions to install Signifyd on your server.

1. Complete the Signifyd configuration for your Magento installation.

## Step 2: Configure your Magento store

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

   _Signifyd configuration_

1. Set **Enable this Solution** to `Yes`.

1. Enter the **API Key**.

   You can obtain the key from the **Settings** page of your Signifyd console.

1. Do not change the default **API URL**, unless instructed to do so.

   Also notice that the **Webhook URL** is displayed. This is the location of the handler that synchronizes the Signifyd guarantee decisions with your store and cannot be changed from the Admin.

1. If you want Magento to keep a log of all interactions between your store and **Signifyd**, set **Debug** to `Yes`.

1. Click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
