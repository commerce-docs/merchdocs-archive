title: Configuring and Accessing the Archive
---

Your store can be configured to archive orders, invoices, shipments, and credit memos after a set number of days. You can move orders and their associated documents to the archive, or restore them to their previous state. Archived orders are not deleted and remain available from the Admin. Archived data can be exported to a CSV file and opened in a spreadsheet. When enabled, the _Go to Archive_ function appears at the top of the Orders workspace.

## Configure the sales archive

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configure**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Sales** and choose **Sales** underneath.
